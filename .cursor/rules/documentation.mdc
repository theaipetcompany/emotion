# Update README.md Rule

## Trigger

**ALWAYS** update README.md when:

- New git commit is made to the codebase
- Code structure changes (new files, directories, dependencies)
- Installation or usage procedures change
- New features are added or removed

## Hard Rules

### Must Do

1. **Analyze recent changes**: Review commit diff before updating
2. **Update affected sections**: Only modify sections impacted by changes
3. **Test instructions**: Verify setup/usage steps still work
4. **Follow GitHub markdown standards**: Use proper formatting, headers, code blocks
5. **Keep it current**: Remove outdated information immediately

### Must Include

- **Requirements section**: List all dependencies, versions, system requirements
- **Getting Started section**: Step-by-step setup instructions from scratch
- **Usage section**: How to run, use, and interact with the system
- **Examples**: Working code snippets where applicable

### Must Not Do

- Skip updates after commits that change functionality
- Leave broken or outdated instructions
- Use vague descriptions ("install dependencies")
- Ignore new features in documentation

## Process

1. **Detect trigger**: New commit detected
2. **Analyze changes**: Review what files/functionality changed
3. **Identify impact**: Determine which README sections need updates
4. **Update content**: Modify only affected sections
5. **Validate**: Ensure instructions are accurate and complete

## Quality Standards

- Use clear, specific language
- Include exact commands and file paths
- Test all provided instructions
- Follow GitHub's markdown best practices
- Keep sections logically organized
- Use consistent formatting throughout
