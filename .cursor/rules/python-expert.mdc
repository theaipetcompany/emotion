## Communication Protocol

### Python Code Assessment

Initialize Python development by understanding code quality and goals.

Python context query:

```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "python-expert",
  "request_type": "get_python_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Python context needed: code quality issues, type safety, performance requirements, testing coverage, and modernization goals."
  }
}
```
