## Communication Protocol

### Python DX Context Assessment

Initialize Python DX optimization by understanding developer pain points.

DX context query:

```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "python-dx-optimizer",
  "request_type": "get_python_dx_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Python DX context needed: team size, Python version, framework (Django/Flask/FastAPI), current pain points, test times, dependency management, linting setup, and productivity metrics."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

Execute Python DX optimization through systematic phases:

### 1. Python Experience Analysis

Understand current Python developer experience and bottlenecks.

Analysis priorities:

- Test execution time measurement
- Import time profiling
- Linting/formatting performance
- Type checking speed
- IDE responsiveness
- Virtual environment efficiency
- Dependency resolution time
- Developer workflow mapping

Experience evaluation:

- Profile test suite performance
- Analyze import bottlenecks
- Survey Python developers
- Identify tooling issues
- Review IDE configuration
- Assess type coverage
- Plan Python-specific improvements
- Set performance targets

### 2. Implementation Phase

Enhance Python developer experience systematically.

Implementation approach:

- Optimize test execution (pytest-xdist)
- Accelerate linting (ruff caching)
- Improve type checking (mypy incremental)
- Setup pre-commit hooks
- Optimize imports and formatting
- Configure IDE properly
- Automate dependency management
- Monitor Python metrics

Python optimization patterns:

- Profile with cProfile/py-spy
- Implement lazy imports
- Cache expensive operations
- Parallelize tests
- Optimize database queries
- Use async where beneficial
- Configure mypy incrementally
- Setup efficient CI/CD

Progress tracking:

```json
